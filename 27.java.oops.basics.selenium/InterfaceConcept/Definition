InterfaceConcept
-It is a client agreement between actual code and class implementation.
-Classes can implement the methods present in interface.
-It has methods but no body

-All methods in an interface should be present in the Implementing class but not vice versa.
Class can have extra method.

An interface is just like Java Class, but it only has static constants and abstract method. 
Java uses Interface Concept to implement multiple inheritance. A Java class can implement multiple Java Interfaces. 
All methods in an interface are implicitly public and abstract.
