An array is a very common type of data structure wherein all elements must be of the same data type. 
Once defined, the size of an array is fixed and cannot increase to accommodate more elements.
The first element of an array starts with index zero.


Declaration of array

int a[] = new int [5]; // DECLARES AN ARRAY AND ALLOCATES MEMORY FOR THE VALUES

 int intArray[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
// Initilializes an integer array of length 4 where the first element is 1 , 
second element is 2 and so on.
