Iterator is used for iterating (looping) various collection classes such as HashMap, ArrayList, LinkedList etc.
‘Iterator’ is an interface which belongs to collection framework. 
It allows us to traverse the collection, access the data element and remove the data elements of the collection.

java.util package has public interface Iterator and contains three methods:
boolean hasNext(): It returns true if Iterator has more element to iterate.

Object next(): It returns the next element in the collection until the hasNext()method return true. 
This method throws ‘NoSuchElementException’ if there is no next element.

void remove(): It removes the current element in the collection. 
This method throws ‘IllegalStateException’ if this function is called before next( ) is invoked.
